    Connectivity nodes are points where terminals of AC conducting equipment are connected
    together with zero impedance. If the model is a TSO EQ, the ConnectivityNodes should be
    grouped under VoltageLevel; If the model is a Boundary EQ, the ConnectivityNodes should
    be grouped under Line; If the model is an assembled one, the ConnectivityNodes can be
    grouped under either VoltageLevel or Line. With this approach the Line is also in the
    Boundary set. Instances of ACLineSegment can be in the Boundary set instance of Line
    or in another instance of Line. Consequently, there can be instances of Line that contain
    only ConnectivityNodes, but no ACLineSegments.
